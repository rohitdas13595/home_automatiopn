Third party Application Configuration 
************************************************************************
1.	Blynk APK

To configure BLYNK go to their official website.
  https://blynk.io/
Blynk was designed for the Internet of Things. It can control hardware remotely, it can display sensor data, it can store data, virtualise it and do many other cool things.
There are three major components in the platform:
•	Blynk App - allows to you create amazing interfaces for your projects using various widgets we provide.
•	Blynk Server - responsible for all the communications between the smartphone and hardware. You can use our Blynk Cloud or run your private Blynk server locally. It’s open-source, could easily handle thousands of devices and can even be launched on a Raspberry Pi.
•	Blynk Libraries - for all the popular hardware platforms - enable communication with the server and process all the incoming and outcoming commands.
Now imagine: every time you press a Button in the Blynk app, the message travels to  the Blynk Cloud, where it magically finds its way to your hardware. It works the same in the opposite direction and everything happens in a blynk of an eye.
